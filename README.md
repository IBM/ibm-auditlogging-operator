# ibm-auditlogging-operator

The ibm-auditlogging-operator contains a Fluentd solution to forward audit data that is generated by IBM Cloud Platform Common Services to a configured SIEM. The operator deploys a Fluentd daemonset containing a systemd input plugin, remote_syslog output plugin, and fluent-plugin-splunk-hec output plugin. It also deploys the Audit logging policy controller.

> **Important**: Do not install this operator directly. Only install this operator using the IBM Common Services Operator. For more information about installing this operator and other Common Services operators, see Installer documentation. If you are using this operator as part of an IBM Cloud Pak, see the documentation for that IBM Cloud Pak to learn more about how to install and use the operator service. For more information about IBM Cloud Paks, see IBM Cloud Paks that use Common Services.

## SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

The ibm-auditlogging-operator supports running with the OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 default restricted Security Context Constraints (SCCs).

## Documentation

To install the operator with the IBM Common Services Operator, follow the installation and configuration instructions within the IBM Knowledge Center.

- If you are using the operator as part of an IBM Cloud Pak, see the documentation for that IBM Cloud Pak. For a list of IBM Cloud Paks, see [IBM Cloud Paks that use Common Services](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_cloudpaks).

- If you are using the operator with an IBM Containerized Software, see the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services Knowledge Center [Installer documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstall).

- For more information, see the [IBM Cloud Platform Common Services documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcsdocs).

## Developer guide

As a developer, if you want to build and test this operator to try out and learn more about the operator and its capabilities, you can use the following developer guide. The guide provides commands for a quick installation and initial validation for running the operator.

> **Important**: The following developer guide is provided as-is and only for trial and education purposes. IBM and IBM Support does not provide any support for the usage of the operator with this developer guide. For the official supported install and usage guide for the operator, see the the IBM Knowledge Center documentation for your IBM Cloud Pak or for IBM Cloud Platform Common Services.

### Overview

- To learn more about how the ibm-auditlogging-operator was implemented, see [Operator Guidelines](https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started#getting-started) and [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/)

- All of the resources that were created by our Helm chart are now created by a controller.

- Audit logging has three CRDs:
  1. `AuditLogging` - [DEPRECATED] A cluster scoped fluentd solution that utilizes journald.
  1. `AuditPolicy` - generated by `audit-policy-controller` repo.
  1. `CommonAudit` - A namespace scoped fluentd solution that utilizes https.

## Configuration

- In order for audit logs to be forwarded to an SIEM, the `fluentd.enabled` spec field must be set to `true`.
- In order to deploy the policy controller, the `policyController.enabled` spec field must be set to `true`.
- If a field in a spec is omitted, the default value will be used.
- The list of all `ibm-auditlogging-operator` settings can be found in the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services Knowledge Center [Configuration Documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstall).

### Developer Guide

- These steps are based on [Operator Framework: Getting Started](https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started#getting-started) and [Creating an App Operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#create-and-deploy-an-app-operator).

- Repositories: [ibm-auditlogging-operator](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-auditlogging-operator)
- Set the Go environment variables:

```bash
  export GOPATH=/home/<username>/go
  export GO111MODULE=on
  export GOPRIVATE="github.ibm.com"
```

- For more information, follow the Operator SDK [Quickstart Guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/quickstart/)

- **IMPORTANT**: Anytime you modify `<kind>_types.go`, you must run `operator-sdk generate k8s`, `operator-sdk generate crds`, and `openapi-gen` again to update the CRD and the generated code.

### Testing

#### Installing by using the OCP Console

1. Create the `ibm-common-services` namespace.
1. Create the [CatalogSource](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-common-service-operator/blob/master/docs/install.md#1create-catalogsource) in your cluster.
1. Select the `Operators` tab and in the drop-down select `OperatorHub`.
1. Search for the `ibm-auditlogging-operator`.
1. Install the operator in the `ibm-common-services` namespace.

#### Prerequisites for building the operator locally

- [Install linters](https://github.com/IBM/go-repo-template/blob/master/docs/development.md)

#### Run the operator

- `make install-all`
- `make run`
- Run tests on the cluster.
- `make uninstall-all`

#### Test Framework

- To run unit tests use, `make test`

#### Debugging the Operator

Run these commands to collect information about the audit logging deployment.

1. `kubectl get pods -n ibm-common-services | grep audit`
1. `kubectl get serviceaccount -n ibm-common-services | grep audit`
1. `kubectl get secrets -n ibm-common-servces | grep audit`
1. `kubectl get services -n ibm-common-services | grep common-audit`

These steps verify:

- The ibm-auditlogging-operator is running.
- The audit logging operand, fluentd, is running.
- The secrets (audit-server-certs, audit-certs) are created.
- The ibm-auditlogging-operator and ibm-auditlogging-operand service accounts are created.
- The common-audit-logging service is created.

Run these commands to collect logs:

1. `kubectl logs <ibm-auditlogging-operator-pod> -c ibm-auditlogging-operator -n ibm-common-services`
1. `kubectl logs <ibm-auditlogging-operator-pod> -c audit-policy-controller -n ibm-common-services`
1. `kubectl logs -n ibm-common-services <audit-logging-fluentd-pods>`

#### End-to-End testing

- For more instructions on how to run end-to-end testing with the Operand Deployment Lifecycle Manager, see [ODLM guide](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-common-service-operator/blob/master/docs/install.md).
