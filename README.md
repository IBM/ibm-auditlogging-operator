# IBM Audit Logging Operator

The IBM Audit Logging Operator contains a Fluentd solution to forward audit data generated by IBM Cloud Platform services to a configured SIEM. The operator deploys a Fluentd daemonset containing a systemd input plugin, remote_syslog output plugin, and fluent-plugin-splunk-hec output plugin. It also deploys the Audit Policy Controller.

## Supported platforms

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.X

## Operator versions

3.5.0

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.11.0 or higher
- Tiller 2.7.2 or higher
- ibm-certmanager-operator must be installed
- Must run in the `ibm-common-services` namespace

## Red Hat OpenShift SCC Requirements

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) `privileged` and `anyuid` have been verified for this operator's operands, Fluentd and the Audit Policy Controller.

## Documentation

For installation and configuration, see [IBM Knowledge Center link].

## Developer guide

### Overview

- Read [Operator Guidelines](https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/roadmap/blob/master/feature-specs/common-services/operator-guideline/operator-guideline-spec.md)
  to learn about the guidelines for Common Services operator.

- An operator can manage one or more controllers. The controller watches the resources for a particular CR (Custom Resource).

- All of the resources that used to be created via a helm chart will be created via a controller.

- Determine how many CRDs (Custom Resource Definition) are needed. auditlogging will have 2 CRDs:
  1. AuditLogging
  1. AuditPolicy (generated by audit-policy-controller repo)

### Development

- These steps are based on [Operator Framework: Getting Started](https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started#getting-started)
  and [Creating an App Operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#create-and-deploy-an-app-operator).

- Repositories
  1. <https://github.com/IBM/ibm-auditlogging-operator>
  1. <https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/audit-logging-operator> - **the code in this repo has been deprecated**

- Set the Go environment variables.

  `export GOPATH=/home/<username>/go`
  `export GO111MODULE=on`
  `export GOPRIVATE="github.ibm.com"`

- Create the operator skeleton.

  ```bash
  cd /home/ibmadmin/workspace/cs-operators
  operator-sdk new auditlogging-operator --repo github.com/ibm/ibm-auditlogging-operator
  ```

  1. the main program for the operator, `cmd/manager/main.go`, initializes and runs the Manager
  1. the Manager will automatically register the scheme for all custom resources defined under `pkg/apis/...` and run all controllers under   `pkg/controller/...`
  1. the Manager can restrict the namespace that all controllers will watch for resources

- Create the API definition ("Kind") which is used to create the CRD

  ```bash
  cd /home/ibmadmin/workspace/cs-operators/auditlogging-operator
  ```

  1. create `hack/boilerplate.go.txt`
  1. contains copyright for generated code

  ```bash
  operator-sdk add api --api-version=operator.ibm.com/v1alpha1 --kind=auditlogging
  ```

  1. generates `pkg/apis/operator/v1alpha1/auditlogging_types.go`
  1. generates `deploy/crds/operator.ibm.com_auditloggings_crd.yaml`
  1. generates `deploy/crds/operator.ibm.com_v1alpha1_auditlogging_cr.yaml`
  1. the operator can manage more than 1 Kind

- Edit `<kind>_types.go` and add the fields that will be exposed to the user. Then regenerate the CRD.
  1. edit `<kind>_types.go` and add fields to the `<Kind>Spec` struct

  ```bash
  operator-sdk generate k8s
  ```

  1. updates `zz_generated.deepcopy.go`
  1. *"Operator Framework: Getting Started" says to run `operator-sdk generate openapi`. That command is deprecated, so run the next 2 commands instead.*

  ```bash
  operator-sdk generate crds
  ```

  1. updates `operator.ibm.com_auditloggings_crd.yaml`
  1. `openapi-gen --logtostderr=true -o "" -i ./pkg/apis/operator/v1alpha1 -O zz_generated.openapi -p ./pkg/apis/operator/v1alpha1 -h hack/boilerplate.go.txt -r "-"`
  1. creates `zz_generated.openapi.go`
  1. if you need to build `openapi-gen`, follow these steps. The binary will be built in `$GOPATH/bin`.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi.git
  cd kube-openapi
  go mod tidy
  go build -o ./bin/openapi-gen k8s.io/kube-openapi/cmd/openapi-gen
  ```

**IMPORTANT**: Anytime you modify `<kind>_types.go`, run `generate k8s`, `generate crds`, and `openapi-gen` again to update the CRD and the generated code

- Create the controller. It will create resources like Deployments, DaemonSets, etc.

  ```bash
  operator-sdk add gicontroller --api-version=operator.ibm.com/v1alpha1 --kind=auditlogging
  ```

  1. there is 1 controller for each Kind/CRD. The controller will watch and reconcile the resources owned by the CR
  1. for information about the Go types that implement Deployments, DaemonSets, etc, go to <https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/apps/v1>
  1. for information about the Go types that implement Pods, VolumeMounts, etc, go to <https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/core/v1>
  1. for information about the Go types that implement Ingress, etc, go to <https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/networking/v1beta1>

### Testing

#### Prerequisites for building the operator locally

- [Install linters](https://github.com/IBM/go-repo-template/blob/master/docs/development.md)

#### Run the operator on a cluster

- `make install`
- Run tests on cluster
- `make uninstall`

#### Run the operator locally

- `cd /home/ibmadmin/workspace/cs-operators/auditlogging-operator`
- `oc login...`
- `export OPERATOR_NAME=auditlogging-operator`
- `operator-sdk up local --namespace=<namespace>`

- Create a CR which is an instance of the CRD
  1. edit `deploy/crds/operator.ibm.com_v1alpha1_auditlogging_cr.yaml`
  1. `kubectl create -f deploy/crds/operator.ibm.com_v1alpha1_auditlogging_cr.yaml`

- Delete the CR and the associated resources that were created
  1. `kubectl delete auditloggings example-auditlogging`
